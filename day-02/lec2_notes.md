# Virtual Environment

    - Install project-specific libraries without affecting other projects.
    - Avoid version conflicts between dependencies.
    - Reduce unneccesary golbal packages usage.

```
python3.14 -m venv env_for_project1

# DATA STRUCTURE
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be used efficiently.

## Lists
List is an ordered(have index), mutable collection that can store multiple values in a single variable. Allows duplicate values.
```
a = [100, 0.63, True, 'aws']
```

- Accessing element
```
print(a[2])
```

- Adding element
```
a.appent("devops")
```
